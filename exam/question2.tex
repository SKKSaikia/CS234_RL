\textbf{\Large Question 2 -- Commuting from Stanford \hfill [14 pts]}
\vspace{0.5cm}

a) San Jose \\
b) $\pi^{ast}(S_1) = bus$, $\pi^{ast}(S_2) = bus$, $\pi^{ast}(S_3) = train$. \\
c) Yes \\
d) The optimal policy is to always take the bus. It differs because the MDP defined in c) is a non-Markovian representation of the actual MDP (in $s_{12}$ there is a dependence on the last action taken) \\
e) Yes in the limit of infinite data. Monte Carlo does not rely on the Markov assumption. \\
