# [CS234 : Reinforcememnt Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html)

OpenAI beating dota pro players, Deepmind beating professional Go players is amazing. DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) is the next hot shot and I sure want to know RL. This is exciting , [here's](https://mvideos.stanford.edu/Previews) the complete first lecture, this is going to be so much fun. Keeping the Honor Code, let's dive deep into Reinforcement Learning.

<p align="justify">To realize the dreams and impact of AI requires autonomous systems that learn to make good decisions. Reinforcement learning is one powerful paradigm for doing so, and it is relevant to an enormous range of tasks, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and healthcare. This class will provide a solid introduction to the field of reinforcement learning and students will learn about the core challenges and approaches, including generalization and exploration. Through a combination of lectures, and written and coding assignments, students will become well versed in key ideas and techniques for RL. Assignments will include the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning — an extremely promising new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning. In addition, students will advance their understanding and the field of RL through an open ended project.</p>

# FINAL PROJECT | [Past Projects](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/project.html)

The list of exciting project in RL domain goes on. [Here](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/CS234_RL/tree/master/poster) are some of the project posters from past year and the [ICML template](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/CS234_RL/blob/master/icml2018_style.tar.gz) to be followed. Good projects are encouraged to be in the standards of [RLDM](http://rldm.org/), [AAMAS](http://www.aamas-conference.org/) etc. Deep Reinforcement Learning, is exciting. Here is my project called, " ".
